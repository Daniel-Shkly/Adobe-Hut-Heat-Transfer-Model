# General Info
In climates characterized by hot days and cold nights, adobe huts are used to mitigate the effects of extreme external
temperatures on the inside of the hut. The walls require a large and relatively long input of heat from the sun and
from the surrounding air before they warm through to the interior. After the sun sets and the temperature drops, the
wall will continue to transfer the heat it built up during the day to the interior for several hours. This causes a time
lag effect on the internal temperature of the hut relative to the outside.

This project is a simplified model showing how heat transfers through the hut over time. All math and details are in IMCS_3020U_Final.pdf.

## Running the Code
All you need to run the model is the Adobe_Hut.py file. Simply download or copy paste the code into whatever IDE you have and run. Follow the prompts to get the ddifferent plots.

### Adjusting Parameters
Change the variables carefully. The code is not super-stable and chaging the values of any parameter (especially n, P1, and P2) has a very good chance of making the numbers explode into absurd values (i.e. 10e+34)
